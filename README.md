This project details my learning experience with front end web development. I start with a figma workup, working my way through HTML, CSS, a relational database, and finally Javascript. My goals are to make the website interactive, and to give the user a pleasant UI/UX experience. I will also use the relational database to add a shopping cart feature, that will allow the user to add items to a cart, and check out when they are finished.
