    <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
    <h3>School Book Fair</h3>
    <p>Every winter, we have a book fair for the elementary school students, to get them to enjoy the magical world
    of reading. We provide a cozy atmosphere, and help students find genres they might be interested in. We enjoy
    seeing their smiling faces, when they find that one book.</p>
    <h3>Charity Book Giveaway</h3>
    <p>Every few months, we give away a selection of our most popular books, for free, to the public. They can take
    as many as they want, and we hope through this effort, that it fosters a love reading within our community.</p>
